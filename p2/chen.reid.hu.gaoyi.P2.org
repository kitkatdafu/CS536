* JLex
  The crux of this project is to come up with a way to distinguish the 4 scenarios of
  string literals. When set a state called =OKSTR= when JLex sees a ="= to indicate that the JLex is
  currently looking at a legal string literal. We let JLex to match one
  character at a time. If JLex sees another ="=, then this string is
  terminated. If JLex sees a =\=, we enter a state called =BACKSLASH=. Now,
  there are two cases. If JLex sees one of $\{n, t, ?, \backslash, "\}$, then it is a
  valid escape, so we go back to state =OKSTR=. On the other hand, if the
  character after =\= is not one of the valid escape character, the JLex enters
  =BAD_ESCAPED= state, indicating that this string literal now is bad. JLex
  check if a string literal in =BAD_ESCAPED= is terminated or not using a
  similar logic as =OKSTR=.
* Testing
  We have created 3 directories to store the testing files. =inputs= stores all
  the inputs, with extension =.in=. =outputs= stores the standard outputs, with
  extension =.out=. =expects= stores the
  expected standard outputs, with extension =.ex=. The correctness of standard errors, i.e. the
  message produced by the =ErrMsg= are checked in the main of P2, instead of
  using =diff= to compare the expected standard outputs and the actual standard outputs.
  The comparision is done using =diff TEST_CASE.out TEST_CASE.ex= in the Makefile.
  To standard error (error messages), we redirect `System.Err` to a customized
  stream. And compare the expected String with the String of the stream.
