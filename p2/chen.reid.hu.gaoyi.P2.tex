\section{JLex}
\label{sec:org26c5035}
The crux of this project is to come up a way to distinguish the 4 scenarios of
string literals. When set a state called \texttt{OKSTR} when JLex sees a \texttt{"} to indicate that the JLex is
currently looking at a legal string literal. We let JLex to match one
character at a time. If JLex sees another \texttt{"}, then this string is
terminated. If JLex sees a \texttt{\textbackslash{}}, we enter a state called \texttt{BACKSLASH}. Now,
there are two cases. If JLex sees one of \(\{n, t, ?, \backslash, "\}\), then it is a
valid escape, so we go back to state \texttt{OKSTR}. On the other hand, if the
character after \texttt{\textbackslash{}} is not one of the valid escape character, the JLex enters
\texttt{BAD\_ESCAPED} state, indicating that this string literal now is bad. JLex
check if a string literal in \texttt{BAD\_ESCAPED} is terminated or not using a
similar logic as \texttt{OKSTR}.
\section{Testing}
\label{sec:org118d62b}
We have created 3 directories to store the testing files. \texttt{inputs} stores all
the inputs. \texttt{outputs} stores the standard outputs. \texttt{expects} stores the
expected standard outputs. The correctness of standard errors, i.e. the
message produced by the \texttt{ErrMsg} are checked in the main of P2, instead of
using \texttt{diff} to compare the expected outputs and the actual outputs.

To standard error (error messages), we redirect `System.Err` to a customized
stream. And compare the expected String with the String of the stream.
