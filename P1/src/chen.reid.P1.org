I first created the =Sym= class and then created the =SymTable= class. While
creating =SymTable=, I also created the two Exception classes. I have decided to
use a =LinkedList= since we only care about the front of the list while adding
and removing scopes. =LinkedList= incurs less time complexity while doing these
operations than =ArrayList=.
